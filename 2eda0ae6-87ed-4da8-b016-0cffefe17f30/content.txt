**Rust** is a programming language that is not only fast, but also memory safe without a garbage collector.
Although programming in Rust takes longer than in other languages, it often times is
1. faster in the end, because errors are prevented while writing the code thanks to the borrow checker
2. *more fun*, because less time is spent debugging
